# project_pandas_data_operations
A trial project on simple data manipulation using pandas
### General Instructions
* __Clone__ or download the repository.
* install packages as mentioned in `requirements.txt`.  (__Optional:__ Use a virtual environment for the project)
* Complete the code cells in accompanied `ipynb` file. Add your code below the `#todo` marks. Do not change anything else in the file. 
* Make sure all the cell blocks run without error.
* Submit just the `.ipynb` file within the stipulated time period. Even if you are not able to complete all the tasks, do submit mentioning that the project is incomplete. However, any project submitted after the stipulated time will not be considered

### Project Instructions
In this project, you need to read the accompanied sample excel file in a pandas dataframe, do various operations and finally store the data as a json string in an output file. 

The input excel contains two rows of headers and two sample data rows. For evaluation purpose, all the non-editable cells in the excel file will remain unchanged. However, the data in the editable cells may get changed. There are various data validations that you need to carry out on the columns. Make sure that the validations work accordingly even when the data is changed.
For your help, the output json file is also available. At the end of the project your output file for the given input shall look exactly like the sample output. However, we encourage you to add/edit data in the input file and thus check the robustness of your code. 


Pay special attention to _column headers_, _json keys_ and the format of the input and output data (strings, integers, date etc). They should be matched exactly as given in the sample input and output file. 

Instructions of individual tasks are available in the `ipynb` file.
